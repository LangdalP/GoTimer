# GoTimer
A simple external bomb-timer for CS:GO, written in Python.

## How to use
You need Python 3, along with the following Python packages
* Flask
* Tkinter (if not installed)
* Requests

With these in place, simply launch go_timer.py ("python go_timer.py")
For Windows users, you can also just click the supplied bat-file.

## Credits
The GameState-listener is inspired by [csgo-c4-hue](https://github.com/doobix/csgo-c4-hue).
I also got some valuable tips from the [Quick Start guide to CS:GO Game State Integration](https://github.com/tsuriga/csgo-gsi-qsguide).
