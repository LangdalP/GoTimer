# GoTimer
A simple external bomb-timer for CS:GO, written in Python. You will not get vacced using this, because it uses [Valve's public gamestate integration](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Game_State_Integration). Now has an easy-to-use installer for Windows users.

## How to get started:

**For Windows users:**

1. Download the latest installer here: https://github.com/LangdalP/GoTimer/releases (installer with cfg)
2. Unzip the file 
3. Install the program. Don't uncheck "Install Python" unless you already have Python 3.
4. Put the file called **gamestate_integration_go_timer.cfg** in X:\PATH_TO_STEAM\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg , where PATH_TO_STEAM is where your steam folder is.
5. Start the program from your start-menu. If CS:GO was launched before you copied the cfg-file, you have to restart it.

**For Ubuntu users:** 

Credits to [testiclopz](https://www.reddit.com/user/testiclopz) for parts of this how-to. It is assumed that python3 is already installed.

1. In the terminal: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
2. Unzip the folder from github anywhere you want
3. Place the gamestate_integration_go_timer.cfg from the listener folder into your cfg folder. The path is typically ~/.steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/csgo/cfg
4. Use the terminal, and make sure that your current directory is in the unzipped folder
5. Type *python3 go_timer.py* to launch the program

I also got some valuable tips from the [Quick Start guide to CS:GO Game State Integration](https://github.com/tsuriga/csgo-gsi-qsguide).

Lastly, a shout-out to [Double0negative for being the first (?) to do this](https://github.com/Double0negative/CSGO-HUD).
